## Presentation: Building Scalable Data Pipelines with Docker and Docker Compose

---

### **1. Introduction to Containerization**

* **Containerization** is the process of packaging applications and their dependencies into isolated, portable environments called **containers**.
* Each container includes everything needed to run: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and configurations.
* Containers ensure **consistency** across environments â€” whether in local development, testing, or production.

**Key Benefits:**

* Portability
* Lightweight compared to virtual machines
* Faster deployment
* Simplified dependency management
* Easy scaling and orchestration

---

### **2. Docker Overview**

**Docker** is the leading containerization platform. It enables you to:

* Build containers using a **Dockerfile**
* Manage images and containers
* Run isolated applications efficiently

**Core Docker Concepts:**

* **Image** â€“ A blueprint of your application (immutable)
* **Container** â€“ A running instance of an image
* **Volume** â€“ Persistent storage for container data
* **Network** â€“ Allows inter-container communication

---

### **3. Docker Compose for Multi-Service Applications**

**Docker Compose** simplifies running multi-container applications using a single YAML configuration file.

Example (from your `docker-compose.yaml`):

```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: airflow
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: airflow
      POSTGRES_DB: airflow
    volumes:
      - ./postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  airflow:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.airflow
    env_file:
      - .env
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
```

This configuration:

* Spins up **PostgreSQL** and **Airflow** containers
* Passes environment variables via `.env`
* Defines inter-service dependencies
* Exposes ports for web UI access

---

### **4. The Role of Docker in Data Pipelines**

In modern data engineering, Docker provides:

* **Isolation:** Each pipeline component (e.g., API extraction, Spark transformation, PostgreSQL loading) runs independently.
* **Reproducibility:** Consistent environments across all developers.
* **Scalability:** Multiple containers can run parallel tasks efficiently.

Your uploaded DAGs are perfect real-world examples:

1. **`youtube_analytics_dag.py`** â€” Automates ingestion and transformation of YouTube channel data using Airflow and PySpark.
2. **`stock_market_dag.py`** â€” Fetches, transforms, and loads stock data from Polygon API to PostgreSQL.

Both DAGs are orchestrated by **Apache Airflow**, running inside a Dockerized environment for reliability.

### **5. Step-by-Step Pipeline Development with Docker**

#### **Step 1: Create a `Dockerfile`**

A `Dockerfile` defines how to build your image.

Example:

```dockerfile
FROM apache/airflow:2.7.3

USER root
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-pip

COPY requirements.txt /requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r /requirements.txt

COPY dags/ /opt/airflow/dags/
COPY scripts/ /opt/airflow/scripts/

USER airflow
```

**Explanation:**

* Uses the official Airflow image as a base.
* Installs dependencies.
* Copies DAGs and scripts into the Airflow container.

---

#### **Step 2: Add a `requirements.txt`**

List all Python dependencies required for your project:

```
apache-airflow==2.7.3
pandas
requests
sqlalchemy
pyspark
psycopg2-binary
```

---

#### **Step 3: Configure Environment Variables (`.env`)**

Sensitive credentials and connection details are managed via `.env`:

```
POSTGRES_USER=airflow
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=airflow
POSTGRES_DB=airflow
POSTGRES_HOST=postgres
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POLYGON_API_KEY=your_polygon_api_key
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key
YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id
```

---

#### **Step 4: Define Services with `docker-compose.yaml`**

This orchestrates Airflow, PostgreSQL, and any Spark or supporting services.

**Run the stack:**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Airflow will automatically detect your DAGs (e.g., `stock_market_dag.py`, `youtube_analytics_dag.py`) and schedule tasks.

---

#### **Step 5: Develop and Deploy the Pipeline**

* **Extract Phase**: Fetch data from APIs
  Example: `extract_stock_data()` in `stock_market_dag.py` uses `requests` with API keys stored in `.env`.

* **Transform Phase**: Clean, validate, and enrich data
  Example: `transform_stock_data()` in the DAG leverages **Pandas**.

* **Load Phase**: Push data to databases
  Example: `load_to_postgres()` loads into PostgreSQL using **SQLAlchemy**.

* **Validation Phase**:
  Final check (`validate_pipeline_execution`) ensures data integrity and logs a summary.

### **6. Running and Monitoring Containers**

**Useful Commands:**

```bash
docker ps              # List running containers
docker logs airflow    # Check logs
docker exec -it airflow bash  # Enter container shell
docker compose down    # Stop and remove all containers
```

Airflow UI available at:
ðŸ‘‰ `http://localhost:8080`

### **7. Benefits of This Approach**

| Feature             | Benefit                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Consistency**     | Identical environment for all developers    |
| **Automation**      | Pipelines run on schedule via Airflow       |
| **Portability**     | Easily deployed on cloud or local machine   |
| **Scalability**     | Add more containers for different pipelines |
| **Maintainability** | Easy updates to individual services         |

---

### **8. Conclusion**

Docker and Docker Compose revolutionize how we design and deploy data pipelines.
By encapsulating tools like Airflow, Spark, and PostgreSQL within containers, we achieve **reliability, reproducibility, and simplicity** in managing end-to-end analytics systems.

Your uploaded examples â€” the **Stock Market ETL** and **YouTube Analytics Pipeline** â€” demonstrate real-world, production-ready containerized workflows that integrate seamlessly under Docker.
